README.md

Through the Mongoose library facilitator, we will build a connection to our database, create a model and create, get and update data through it!

Make sure to start on the main branch, and check out the other branches to see the changes made to the code, step by step.
The command is simply "git checkout step-x" where x is the number of the step you want to see.
For every commit, the README file will be updated as well, make sure to check it out too!
